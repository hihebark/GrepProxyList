# changeMyMAC
A small script with bash to change you'r mac address. I create this script because of network-manager don't change my mac after restart it.

# Usage:
`# bash changeMyMAC.sh [-r | -m ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff | -p]`
`# bash changeMyMAC.sh -r` for a random mac
`# bash changeMyMAC.sh -m ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` to change you'r MAC to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
`# bash changeMyMAC.sh -p` to change to you'r permanent MAC
Done!
